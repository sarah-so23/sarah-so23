<h1>Our Story</h1>
<p>Pearly Crochet started as an old-time hobby as most crocheters start as. But over time we saw how much joy crochet gifts bring to others. Pearly Crochet was founded by Elvira Sully, who was named after the iconic Mistresses of Darkness herself. Elvira started crocheting at 10 years old and somehow never stopped. Now at age 24, she has started the first steps of her e-commerce business.</p>

<h2>Our Mission</h2>
<p>Is to help those find their best matches in the crochet fashion industry.
</p>

<h2>Our Promise</h2>
<p>We promise to be truthful to our customers and strive to be the best and provide the best. We will never stop improving!
</p>

<h1>Why Us?</h1>
<p>Even though our business is on the younger side, there's one thing we have that surprisingly enough other businesses don't always prioritize, and that's customer connections. Pearly Crochet is more than just a business, it is art and art made by real living people. Everything that all crochet projects are handmade and take a considerable amount of time. We want to treat people with respect the same thing that we would like as well.
</p>
<p>WE LOVE YOU PEARLY BEAUTIES!</p>
